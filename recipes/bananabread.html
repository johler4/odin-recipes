  <h2>Almost no fat banana bread</h2>
  <p>I know what you're thinking, banana bread with no fat? Ain't no way! I'm in disbelief too. And even after trying this bread out for myself, I think they're lying to us. My tastebuds enjoy the flavor of this bread too much for it to be fat-free.</p>
  <p>The moistness of this bread will remind you of Niagara Falls. So much so that you should probably wear a raincoat while eating it. Or at least one of those bibs they give you when you go to Red Lobster.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 cup banana, mashed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup applesauce</li>
    <li>2 egg whites</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan.</li>
    <li>Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add banana, applesauce, and egg whites; stir just until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Turn out onto a wire rack and allow to cool before slicing.</li>
