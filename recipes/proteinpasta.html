  <h2>More Protein = More Muscle</h2>
  <p>You want to bulk up right? You want to get the gains that your putting in some much work at the gym for? Then eat you some more calories! Protein pasta is a good way to get in your daily caloric goal while also getting in those mass amounts of protein that you need. You think Hercules got jacked eating apples all day? Fuck no. And don't listen to Pop-eye's bitch ass. Spinach won't give you the gains that this pasta does.</p>
  <p>But seriously, although this pasta has the carbs that you don't want in intake, the protein to calorie ratio is great. Work this into your diet and soon enough you'll have a milkshake that'll bring all the boys to the yard.</p>
