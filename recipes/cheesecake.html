  <h2>This cheesecake recipes slaaapppppssssss!</h2>
  <p>The cheesecake that is birthed from this recipe is like no other. It's so insanely good that it won't just make you want to slap your momma, it'll make you slap yourself too. Why? Because you'll think that the only way that anything could taste this good would be if you're sleeping. You're gonna ask somebody to pinch you cuz this cheesecake tastes better than J-Lo's bootyhole. But don't fret. You're not asleep. And I don't ever wanna see you and I never wanna miss you again. Unless you're making this cheesecake</p>
  <p>Be sure to take your time when making this recipe. Only choose the finest ingredients. Be gentle to them. Caress them. Make sweet, sweet love to them. Even add some toppings if you'd like. Chocolate ganache, strawberry jam, candied walnuts. Add whatever you'd like to it, just don't treat it poorly.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, from 12 whole crackers</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>32oz cream cheese, at room temp</li>
    <li>2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon packed lemon zest, from 1 lemon</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, from that same lemon</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>6 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>9 or 10 inch springform pan, 18 inch heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees farenheit and set an oven rack in the lower middle position. Wrap the springform pan in the aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending up all the sides. Repeat with a second layer of foil. Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt. Stir until well combined. Press the crumbs into an even layer on the the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside.</li>
    <li>Reduce the oven temp to 325 farenheit and set a kettle of water to boil.</li>
    <li>Make the batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and flour together on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined. Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary. Mix in the sour cream. Make sure the batter is uniform but do not over-mix.</li>
    <li>Check to make sure your oven has cooled to 325Â°F, then set the cheesecake pan in a large roasting pan. Pour the batter on top of the crust. Pour the boiling water into the large roasting pan to come about 1 inch up the side of the cake pan. Bake until the cake is just set, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. (If the cheesecake starts to look too golden on top towards the end, cover it loosely with foil.) The cake should not look liquidy at all but will wobble just a bit when the pan is nudged; it will continue to cook as it cools. Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath and discard the foil. If necessary, run a thin-bladed knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it's not sticking to the sides (which can cause cracks as it cools), then cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to cool for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
