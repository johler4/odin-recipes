My first project with Odin- a recipe website!

In this project I will demonstrate different HTML and CSS elements that I

for several recipes. I'm thinking Thanksgiving recipes since Thanksgiving
is in two days.

Hello Odin!

Adding some lines to practice git add, git status, git commit, git status
again, and then git push
